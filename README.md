## Hi there! I'm [Paolo Combi](https://combi.li) a Senior Software Engineer @ [AMBOSS GmbH](https://www.amboss.com/). 

I'm just trying to solve problems with code and jokes (usually the latter are more effective) and a lot of enthusiasm (if enthusiasm was a programming language, I'd be a staff engineer by now).

Just like a good joke, my code is clean, efficient, and always gets a good laugh from my team.  
I may not be the best coder in the world, but I'm definitely the funniest (and modest).   
When I'm not staring at my computer screen, you can find me biking, training for my next (half)marathon or defragment my life over a good coffe/beer with friends.


Feel free to take a look at my repositories and leave a comment or suggestion - I'm always open to constructive criticism as long as it's not too harsh (i could get emotional).  
I hope these gives you some inspiration!   
Happy coding!
