## Hi there! I'm [Paolo Combi](https://combi.li) a Senior Software Engineer @ [Vinted](https://www.vinted.com/). 

I'm trying to solve problems with code and jokes (usually the latter are more effective) and a lot of enthusiasm (if enthusiasm were a programming language, I'd be a staff engineer by now).

Like a good joke, my code is clean, efficient, and always gets a good laugh from my team.  
I may not be the best coder in the world, but I'm the funniest (and modest).   
When I'm not staring at my computer screen, you can find me biking, training for my next (half)marathon, or defragging my life over a good coffee/beer with friends.


Feel free to look at my repositories and leave a comment or suggestion - I'm always open to constructive criticism as long as it's not too harsh (I could get emotional).  
I hope this gives you some inspiration!   
Happy coding!
